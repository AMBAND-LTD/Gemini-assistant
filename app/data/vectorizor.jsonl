Early Childhood Development (ECD) \u2013 Our focus is on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Areas of Focus: I nclusive Quality Education: is focused on understanding how to make education systems responsive to the learning needs of children and youth from diverse backgrounds. This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women\u2019s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others.

This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children\u2019s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women\u2019s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8. We will use an approach that promotes equitable access to a high-quality early childhood experience and consider ways to enhance school readiness as children enter the schooling system at age 4 to ensure schooling success.

The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) \u2013 Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding.

This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) \u2013 The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) \u2013 Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet.

This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) \u2013 The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH\u2014ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems.

Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people\u2019s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people\u2019s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people\u2019s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people\u2019s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care.

Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit \u2013 The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on \u201cmanagement\u201d signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from \u201ccure\u201d to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) \u2013 Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology", "source": "data/token.jsonl"}

Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) \u2013 The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance.

To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country\u2019s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better.

Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons\u2014LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit \u2013 The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national).

Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) \u2013 Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) \u2013 The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers.

Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming.

Our focus extends to adapting societal structures to accommodate demographic shifts, promoting age-friendly environments, and enhancing the socio-economic support systems vital for older populations. Urbanization and Sustainability: PDU explores the broader issues of migration and urbanization in Africa and their implications for developing sustainable and resilient cities. We particularly focus on the growth of informal settlements within Africa\u2019s rapid urbanization context, seeking to generate robust evidence on social determinants of health and well-being to inform policy and action towards addressing unique challenges of slum dwellers, transcending urban poverty to foster inclusive and sustainable urban development.

If a portfolio is merely a collection of work stored in folders, it loses significance for both teachers and students. While gathering and selecting portfolio entries can be beneficial, the true value of portfolio development emerges when educators engage in meaningful discussions about the contents and their implications. Careful consideration must be given to what goes into a portfolio, the selection and organization processes, and how the information will be utilized. It is essential to emphasize that portfolios should facilitate reflective practice in teacher preparation. Hibbert and Cunliffe (2015) describe reflexive practice as the process of examining one\u2019s own experiences, concentrating on personal beliefs and assumptions in relation to others, to foster improvement. To promote reflective teaching, a clear understanding of the reflection processes involved in portfolio development and guidance on what aspects students should reflect upon are necessary. Student-teacher portfolios should encourage prospective educators to become reflective practitioners, enabling them to better connect theory with classroom practice throughout their preparation for effective teacher development. A teaching portfolio represents a teacher\u2019s professional identity. It showcases carefully selected information about teaching activities, evidence of their effectiveness, and critical reflections on each task.

Teaching practice is vital to preparing student teachers for their instructional roles, equipping them with the skills necessary for personal and professional development. Teacher evaluation remains a priority within the educational system, and portfolios of evidence\u2014commonly referred to as teaching portfolios\u2014have been embraced by many universities, including those from Kenya, as a critical evaluation tool during teaching practice (Seldin, 2000; Subbaye & Vithal, 2015, Nungari & Odhiambo, 2022 ). What is a portfolio?A portfolio is defined as a tool that supports the professional development and growth of teachers by documenting their achievements, which can be submitted for promotions or other employment opportunities (Davis, 2009; South Africa Council on Higher Education Monitor, 2017; Sebolao 2019). A portfolio serves as a valuable resource for improving teaching materials (Seldin, 2000) and critical thinking skills (Mall-Amiri & Askarzadeh, 2018). If a portfolio is merely a collection of work stored in folders, it loses significance for both teachers and students. While gathering and selecting portfolio entries can be beneficial, the true value of portfolio development emerges when educators engage in meaningful discussions about the contents and their implications. Careful consideration must be given to what goes into a portfolio, the selection and organization processes, and how the information will be utilized.

A teaching portfolio represents a teacher\u2019s professional identity.

Our focus extends to adapting societal structures to accommodate demographic shifts, promoting age-friendly environments, and enhancing the socio-economic support systems vital for older populations. Urbanization and Sustainability: PDU explores the broader issues of migration and urbanization in Africa and their implications for developing sustainable and resilient cities. We particularly focus on the growth of informal settlements within Africa\u2019s rapid urbanization context, seeking to generate robust evidence on social determinants of health and well-being to inform policy and action towards addressing unique challenges of slum dwellers, transcending urban poverty to foster inclusive and sustainable urban development. Fertility: Our research emphasizes understanding fertility determinants in Africa, probing why fertility rates remain persistently high in specific contexts, identifying factors contributing to stalled fertility declines, and investigating rapid declines among specific demographic groups.", "source": "data/token.jsonl"}

The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable.

Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people\u2019s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care.

The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) \u2013 Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges.

Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) \u2013 The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH\u2014ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people\u2019s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people\u2019s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14", "source": "data/token.jsonl"}

Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people\u2019s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people\u2019s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons\u2014LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit \u2013 The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national).

Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) \u2013 Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury.

Early Childhood Development (ECD) \u2013 Our focus is on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Areas of Focus: I nclusive Quality Education: is focused on understanding how to make education systems responsive to the learning needs of children and youth from diverse backgrounds. This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women\u2019s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others.

Education and Technology: Understanding how countries in SSA could leverage education technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children\u2019s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women\u2019s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8. We will use an approach that promotes equitable access to a high-quality early childhood experience and consider ways to enhance school readiness as children enter the schooling system at age 4 to ensure schooling success.
