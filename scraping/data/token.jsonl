OVERVIEW In the stream of work on Education and Technology, we seek to understand how African countries can leverage technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. Education and Youth Empowerment (EYE) – The perspectives of equity, inclusion, and opportunities are the guiding principles for our work in EYE. Early Childhood Development (ECD) – Our focus is on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Areas of Focus: I nclusive Quality Education: is focused on understanding how to make education systems responsive to the learning needs of children and youth from diverse backgrounds. This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women’s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others. Youth and Transition to Work: Investigates pathways to the world of work among young people in SSA. This includes addressing issues of positive youth development, youth empowerment and skills development, skills-building and training systems and the future of work, apprenticeship programs for young people, and demand-driven training for the future of work. Education and Technology: Understanding how countries in SSA could leverage education technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children’s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women’s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8. We will use an approach that promotes equitable access to a high-quality early childhood experience and consider ways to enhance school readiness as children enter the schooling system at age 4 to ensure schooling success.

Areas of Focus: I nclusive Quality Education: is focused on understanding how to make education systems responsive to the learning needs of children and youth from diverse backgrounds. This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women’s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others. Youth and Transition to Work: Investigates pathways to the world of work among young people in SSA. This includes addressing issues of positive youth development, youth empowerment and skills development, skills-building and training systems and the future of work, apprenticeship programs for young people, and demand-driven training for the future of work. Education and Technology: Understanding how countries in SSA could leverage education technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children’s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women’s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8. We will use an approach that promotes equitable access to a high-quality early childhood experience and consider ways to enhance school readiness as children enter the schooling system at age 4 to ensure schooling success.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) – Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) – The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH—ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people’s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better. Related Projects PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2020 – 2021 Surveillance and Epidemiologic Evaluation of COVID-19 in Kenya (SEECK) The burden of COVID-19 at population level is not known and prevention interventions are not fully supported by evidence. This project seeks to answer the question of: what proportion of the general population has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before? The study is being conducted in the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) area (Korogocho and Viwandani informal settlements) on the outskirts of Nairobi City. Similar studies are being implemented in Kisumu and Kilifi by other research teams within the wider consortium.

Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH—ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people’s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) – Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities.

By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH—ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people’s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better. Related Projects PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2020 – 2021 Surveillance and Epidemiologic Evaluation of COVID-19 in Kenya (SEECK) The burden of COVID-19 at population level is not known and prevention interventions are not fully supported by evidence. This project seeks to answer the question of: what proportion of the general population has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before? The study is being conducted in the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) area (Korogocho and Viwandani informal settlements) on the outskirts of Nairobi City. Similar studies are being implemented in Kisumu and Kilifi by other research teams within the wider consortium. ONGOING PROJECT 2021 – 2023 PATIENT-LED SUPPORT GROUPS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION AND DIABETES IN KOROGOCHO AND VIWANDANDI INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS, NAIROBI, KENYA: MIXED METHODS STUDY OF AN INNOVATIVE MODEL (MRC PaLs) ONGOING PROJECT 2017 – 2021 Improving Healthcare Delivery in Informal Settlements Rapid urbanization in major cities in Africa, has contributed to a surge in informal settlements, also commonly referred to as slums. ONGOING PROJECT 2017 – 2019 Food Choices Project: Dietary transitions in African Cities Driven in part by the increasing migration of individuals to cities in many African countries, a change in dietary habits has been observed, with increasing consumption of unhealthy foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients."}

{"text": "OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) – Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) – The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa.

Our research endeavors aim to advance understanding of significant population trends in Africa, their ecological interactions, and the implications of climate change for sustainable development. OVERVIEW Our critical areas of work broadly include: Aging and Development: We investigate the dynamics of population aging in Africa, analyzing its impact on well-being, life-course trajectories, transitions to long-term care, and access to essential services for older populations. Our focus extends to adapting societal structures to accommodate demographic shifts, promoting age-friendly environments, and enhancing the socio-economic support systems vital for older populations. Urbanization and Sustainability: PDU explores the broader issues of migration and urbanization in Africa and their implications for developing sustainable and resilient cities. We particularly focus on the growth of informal settlements within Africa’s rapid urbanization context, seeking to generate robust evidence on social determinants of health and well-being to inform policy and action towards addressing unique challenges of slum dwellers, transcending urban poverty to foster inclusive and sustainable urban development. Fertility: Our research emphasizes understanding fertility determinants in Africa, probing why fertility rates remain persistently high in specific contexts, identifying factors contributing to stalled fertility declines, and investigating rapid declines among specific demographic groups.

OVERVIEW Our critical areas of work broadly include: Aging and Development: We investigate the dynamics of population aging in Africa, analyzing its impact on well-being, life-course trajectories, transitions to long-term care, and access to essential services for older populations. Our focus extends to adapting societal structures to accommodate demographic shifts, promoting age-friendly environments, and enhancing the socio-economic support systems vital for older populations. Urbanization and Sustainability: PDU explores the broader issues of migration and urbanization in Africa and their implications for developing sustainable and resilient cities. We particularly focus on the growth of informal settlements within Africa’s rapid urbanization context, seeking to generate robust evidence on social determinants of health and well-being to inform policy and action towards addressing unique challenges of slum dwellers, transcending urban poverty to foster inclusive and sustainable urban development. Fertility: Our research emphasizes understanding fertility determinants in Africa, probing why fertility rates remain persistently high in specific contexts, identifying factors contributing to stalled fertility declines, and investigating rapid declines among specific demographic groups.

OVERVIEW Our work in this area leverages advances in platform development to create robust data systems that ensure data are shared, governed, and analyzed with novel methods. The Data Science program leverages internally and externally generated “big data” to explore patterns and predictions using data science, artificial intelligence tools, and modeling approaches to inform population health. Units and working groups Data Platforms and Systems . The team focuses on creating platforms and systems that support the data value chain. Current and planned platforms include; Data Science and Sharing Platform (DASSA) . This is a data-sharing platform with interfaces that support stories on data sharing, information on legal policies and frameworks for data protection in various African countries, provides modules for data sharing, and collates data from various sources – including internally generated research datasets at the center. No-Code Machine Learning Platform. This supports codeless machine learning algorithms easily deployed by researchers who are not necessarily data science professionals. The graphical user face allows users to use research datasets uploaded to the platform, and real-time predictive analytics are generated with accompanying interpretations for the user. Data Governance. The data governance team works closely with the data synergy team to develop a data governance framework for APHRC. Additional work includes creating a data governance curriculum on data governance, data anonymization, privacy-preserving technologies, and responsible data use. The Data Science team collaborates with the RRCS to deliver the proposed training. Data Harmonization and FAIR. The team of data documentationists and data scientists create data pipelines for various use cases and support on-premise and cloud-based data analysis through a federated approach. The team uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model – a standardized data model for health data with internationally recognized vocabularies. The platform harmonizes data generated internally and externally through the Center’s partnership projects across Africa and beyond. In addition, metadata for APHRC research datasets is indexed and made machine searchable using tools such as Schema.org to increase visibility and allow global data sharing. Data Analytics and Evaluation. A team of experienced data scientists, statisticians,s and mathematical modelers support data analytical support for “big-data” driven projects. The team uses machine learning techniques and new tools like Generative Artificial Intelligence to develop robust outputs that inform decision-making and impact lives through research. INSPIRE Network The Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) is hosted by the Data Science Program. INSPIRE was birthed in 2019 as a Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) network in East Africa. The vision has since changed and now hosts about 20 HDSS sites in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda), Western Africa (Senegal, Burkina Faso), and Southern (Malawi) Africa. The INSPIRE secretariat provides; An annual general meeting to discuss value addition and collaboration among HDSS Period hybrid training in data harmonization for data managers at the respective sites Promotes federated data-sharing models for collaborative and joining analyses Addressed recurrent challenges faced by HDSS e.g. record linkage A platform for joint grant application across the network members Related Projects ONGOING PROJECT 2024 – 2024 The Gates Data System PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2019 – 2022 STRENGTHENING MEASUREMENT AND IMPACT EVALUATION CAPACITY AT APHRC ONGOING PROJECT 2020 – 2021 Sex, Gender and COVID-19 The Sex, Gender and Covid-19 Project is a partnership of Global Health 50/50 (UCL), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC).

The Data Science program leverages internally and externally generated “big data” to explore patterns and predictions using data science, artificial intelligence tools, and modeling approaches to inform population health. Units and working groups Data Platforms and Systems . The team focuses on creating platforms and systems that support the data value chain. Current and planned platforms include; Data Science and Sharing Platform (DASSA) . This is a data-sharing platform with interfaces that support stories on data sharing, information on legal policies and frameworks for data protection in various African countries, provides modules for data sharing, and collates data from various sources – including internally generated research datasets at the center. No-Code Machine Learning Platform. This supports codeless machine learning algorithms easily deployed by researchers who are not necessarily data science professionals. The graphical user face allows users to use research datasets uploaded to the platform, and real-time predictive analytics are generated with accompanying interpretations for the user. Data Governance. The data governance team works closely with the data synergy team to develop a data governance framework for APHRC. Additional work includes creating a data governance curriculum on data governance, data anonymization, privacy-preserving technologies, and responsible data use. The Data Science team collaborates with the RRCS to deliver the proposed training. Data Harmonization and FAIR. The team of data documentationists and data scientists create data pipelines for various use cases and support on-premise and cloud-based data analysis through a federated approach. The team uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model – a standardized data model for health data with internationally recognized vocabularies. The platform harmonizes data generated internally and externally through the Center’s partnership projects across Africa and beyond. In addition, metadata for APHRC research datasets is indexed and made machine searchable using tools such as Schema.org to increase visibility and allow global data sharing. Data Analytics and Evaluation. A team of experienced data scientists, statisticians,s and mathematical modelers support data analytical support for “big-data” driven projects. The team uses machine learning techniques and new tools like Generative Artificial Intelligence to develop robust outputs that inform decision-making and impact lives through research. INSPIRE Network The Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) is hosted by the Data Science Program. INSPIRE was birthed in 2019 as a Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) network in East Africa. The vision has since changed and now hosts about 20 HDSS sites in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda), Western Africa (Senegal, Burkina Faso), and Southern (Malawi) Africa. The INSPIRE secretariat provides; An annual general meeting to discuss value addition and collaboration among HDSS Period hybrid training in data harmonization for data managers at the respective sites Promotes federated data-sharing models for collaborative and joining analyses Addressed recurrent challenges faced by HDSS e.g. record linkage A platform for joint grant application across the network members"}

Sustainable policy impact entails transformative change in systems, investments, programs, and behavior. The Center is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture of public engagement. We achieve this by engaging in genuine dialogues with defined local and global communities. Our mission is to inform and influence policy discussions and decision-making by identifying and nurturing champions within and outside government. Our ultimate goal is to stimulate greater interest in evidence-driven policies and programs. OVERVIEW We emphasize strong cross-organizational collaboration with a focus on structured and strategic engagement. We work within key thematic areas, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, food systems, health system strengthening, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), with gender and climate change as cross-cutting themes. While our primary focus is on these signature issues, we are flexible and occasionally collaborate on other significant topics. Our advocacy efforts take a comprehensive approach underpinning our commitment to driving substantial and lasting regional policy changes. It revolves around three strategies: Building partnerships with key policy stakeholders to lead policy changes and provide support in policy processes. Strengthening the capacity of strategic stakeholders within the African policy ecosystem to generate, synthesize, and utilize evidence for improved policy and practice. Promoting evidence-based decision-making through robust relationships, joint evidence projects, evidence co-creation, rapid synthesis, policy analysis, and problem-driven Political Economy Analyses (PEA).

Sustainable policy impact entails transformative change in systems, investments, programs, and behavior. The Center is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture of public engagement. We achieve this by engaging in genuine dialogues with defined local and global communities. Our mission is to inform and influence policy discussions and decision-making by identifying and nurturing champions within and outside government. Our ultimate goal is to stimulate greater interest in evidence-driven policies and programs. OVERVIEW We emphasize strong cross-organizational collaboration with a focus on structured and strategic engagement. We work within key thematic areas, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, food systems, health system strengthening, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), with gender and climate change as cross-cutting themes. While our primary focus is on these signature issues, we are flexible and occasionally collaborate on other significant topics. Our advocacy efforts take a comprehensive approach underpinning our commitment to driving substantial and lasting regional policy changes. It revolves around three strategies: Building partnerships with key policy stakeholders to lead policy changes and provide support in policy processes.

Teaching practice is vital to preparing student teachers for their instructional roles, equipping them with the skills necessary for personal and professional development. Teacher evaluation remains a priority within the educational system, and portfolios of evidence—commonly referred to as teaching portfolios—have been embraced by many universities, including those from Kenya, as a critical evaluation tool during teaching practice (Seldin, 2000; Subbaye & Vithal, 2015, Nungari & Odhiambo, 2022 ). What is a portfolio?A portfolio is defined as a tool that supports the professional development and growth of teachers by documenting their achievements, which can be submitted for promotions or other employment opportunities (Davis, 2009; South Africa Council on Higher Education Monitor, 2017; Sebolao 2019). A portfolio serves as a valuable resource for improving teaching materials (Seldin, 2000) and critical thinking skills (Mall-Amiri & Askarzadeh, 2018). If a portfolio is merely a collection of work stored in folders, it loses significance for both teachers and students. While gathering and selecting portfolio entries can be beneficial, the true value of portfolio development emerges when educators engage in meaningful discussions about the contents and their implications. Careful consideration must be given to what goes into a portfolio, the selection and organization processes, and how the information will be utilized. It is essential to emphasize that portfolios should facilitate reflective practice in teacher preparation. Hibbert and Cunliffe (2015) describe reflexive practice as the process of examining one’s own experiences, concentrating on personal beliefs and assumptions in relation to others, to foster improvement. To promote reflective teaching, a clear understanding of the reflection processes involved in portfolio development and guidance on what aspects students should reflect upon are necessary. Student-teacher portfolios should encourage prospective educators to become reflective practitioners, enabling them to better connect theory with classroom practice throughout their preparation for effective teacher development. A teaching portfolio represents a teacher’s professional identity. It showcases carefully selected information about teaching activities, evidence of their effectiveness, and critical reflections on each task. Ultimately, the portfolio reaches its full potential when it catalyzes professional dialogue and growth. This blog demonstrates how portfolios can be a reflective learning instrument in the assessment process.

{"text": "BLOG ARTICLE Reflective Portfolios for Teacher Professional Development October 4, 2024 CONTRIBUTORS Mchungwani Saad Rashid Research Officer VIEW PROFILE On World Teachers’ Day, we celebrate the remarkable contributions of educators, acknowledging the unique challenges they face and the importance of empowering them to build resilience early in their careers. Teaching practice is vital to preparing student teachers for their instructional roles, equipping them with the skills necessary for personal and professional development. Teacher evaluation remains a priority within the educational system, and portfolios of evidence—commonly referred to as teaching portfolios—have been embraced by many universities, including those from Kenya, as a critical evaluation tool during teaching practice (Seldin, 2000; Subbaye & Vithal, 2015, Nungari & Odhiambo, 2022 ). What is a portfolio?A portfolio is defined as a tool that supports the professional development and growth of teachers by documenting their achievements, which can be submitted for promotions or other employment opportunities (Davis, 2009; South Africa Council on Higher Education Monitor, 2017; Sebolao 2019). A portfolio serves as a valuable resource for improving teaching materials (Seldin, 2000) and critical thinking skills (Mall-Amiri & Askarzadeh, 2018). If a portfolio is merely a collection of work stored in folders, it loses significance for both teachers and students. While gathering and selecting portfolio entries can be beneficial, the true value of portfolio development emerges when educators engage in meaningful discussions about the contents and their implications. Careful consideration must be given to what goes into a portfolio, the selection and organization processes, and how the information will be utilized. It is essential to emphasize that portfolios should facilitate reflective practice in teacher preparation. Hibbert and Cunliffe (2015) describe reflexive practice as the process of examining one’s own experiences, concentrating on personal beliefs and assumptions in relation to others, to foster improvement. To promote reflective teaching, a clear understanding of the reflection processes involved in portfolio development and guidance on what aspects students should reflect upon are necessary. Student-teacher portfolios should encourage prospective educators to become reflective practitioners, enabling them to better connect theory with classroom practice throughout their preparation for effective teacher development. A teaching portfolio represents a teacher’s professional identity. It showcases carefully selected information about teaching activities, evidence of their effectiveness, and critical reflections on each task. Ultimately, the portfolio reaches its full potential when it catalyzes professional dialogue and growth.

Thus, existing policies tend to be discriminatory, impractical, or non-inclusive. There is need for capacity strengthening among SRHR researchers in the Anglophone African region to develop research leaders and partners who will drive generation of evidence and institutionalization of innovations to inform policy. Led by APHRC, the World Health Organization Human Reproduction Program (WHO-HRP) Alliance Research and Knowledge Transfer Hub seeks to enable African institutions to generate their own appropriate and contextual solutions to SRHR challenges and adopt them into policy and practice. Specific Objectives To strengthen capacities of individuals to engage effectively in SRHR implementation research, policy process and dissemination of SRHR research output To support institutionalization of tools developed by trained individuals at their home institutions or regions To enhance uptake of research output in policy-making via facilitation of researchers-policymakers interactions and other dissemination efforts Expected outcomes Trained SRHR research leaders capable of driving SRHR research agenda in their respective institutions and countries Strengthened African institutions and countries capable of generating their own appropriate and contextual solutions to SRHR challenges and adopt them into policy and practice Establishment of a high-quality knowledge translation infrastructure capable of providing evidence-informed, relevant and cost-oriented support to policymakers on SRHR issues. Project outputs so far Since inception, the project has built the research capacities of 458 researchers through 16 short courses and workshops on SRHR-related topics. The project has also supported four masters’ students currently working on SRHR topics to complete their master’s projects, published four papers, presented a toolkit on adolescent health at an international conference, and won four grants jointly with partner institutions/hubs. The hub has also conducted six webinars involving Anglophone and Francophone African countries reaching more than 428 individuals.

Thus, existing policies tend to be discriminatory, impractical, or non-inclusive. There is need for capacity strengthening among SRHR researchers in the Anglophone African region to develop research leaders and partners who will drive generation of evidence and institutionalization of innovations to inform policy. Led by APHRC, the World Health Organization Human Reproduction Program (WHO-HRP) Alliance Research and Knowledge Transfer Hub seeks to enable African institutions to generate their own appropriate and contextual solutions to SRHR challenges and adopt them into policy and practice. Specific Objectives To strengthen capacities of individuals to engage effectively in SRHR implementation research, policy process and dissemination of SRHR research output To support institutionalization of tools developed by trained individuals at their home institutions or regions To enhance uptake of research output in policy-making via facilitation of researchers-policymakers interactions and other dissemination efforts Expected outcomes Trained SRHR research leaders capable of driving SRHR research agenda in their respective institutions and countries Strengthened African institutions and countries capable of generating their own appropriate and contextual solutions to SRHR challenges and adopt them into policy and practice Establishment of a high-quality knowledge translation infrastructure capable of providing evidence-informed, relevant and cost-oriented support to policymakers on SRHR issues. Project outputs so far Since inception, the project has built the research capacities of 458 researchers through 16 short courses and workshops on SRHR-related topics. The project has also supported four masters’ students currently working on SRHR topics to complete their master’s projects, published four papers, presented a toolkit on adolescent health at an international conference, and won four grants jointly with partner institutions/hubs. The hub has also conducted six webinars involving Anglophone and Francophone African countries reaching more than 428 individuals.

OVERVIEW Our work in this area leverages advances in platform development to create robust data systems that ensure data are shared, governed, and analyzed with novel methods. The Data Science program leverages internally and externally generated “big data” to explore patterns and predictions using data science, artificial intelligence tools, and modeling approaches to inform population health. Units and working groups Data Platforms and Systems . The team focuses on creating platforms and systems that support the data value chain. Current and planned platforms include; Data Science and Sharing Platform (DASSA) . This is a data-sharing platform with interfaces that support stories on data sharing, information on legal policies and frameworks for data protection in various African countries, provides modules for data sharing, and collates data from various sources – including internally generated research datasets at the center. No-Code Machine Learning Platform. This supports codeless machine learning algorithms easily deployed by researchers who are not necessarily data science professionals. The graphical user face allows users to use research datasets uploaded to the platform, and real-time predictive analytics are generated with accompanying interpretations for the user. Data Governance. The data governance team works closely with the data synergy team to develop a data governance framework for APHRC. Additional work includes creating a data governance curriculum on data governance, data anonymization, privacy-preserving technologies, and responsible data use. The Data Science team collaborates with the RRCS to deliver the proposed training. Data Harmonization and FAIR. The team of data documentationists and data scientists create data pipelines for various use cases and support on-premise and cloud-based data analysis through a federated approach. The team uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model – a standardized data model for health data with internationally recognized vocabularies. The platform harmonizes data generated internally and externally through the Center’s partnership projects across Africa and beyond. In addition, metadata for APHRC research datasets is indexed and made machine searchable using tools such as Schema.org to increase visibility and allow global data sharing. Data Analytics and Evaluation. A team of experienced data scientists, statisticians,s and mathematical modelers support data analytical support for “big-data” driven projects. The team uses machine learning techniques and new tools like Generative Artificial Intelligence to develop robust outputs that inform decision-making and impact lives through research. INSPIRE Network The Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) is hosted by the Data Science Program. INSPIRE was birthed in 2019 as a Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) network in East Africa. The vision has since changed and now hosts about 20 HDSS sites in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda), Western Africa (Senegal, Burkina Faso), and Southern (Malawi) Africa. The INSPIRE secretariat provides; An annual general meeting to discuss value addition and collaboration among HDSS Period hybrid training in data harmonization for data managers at the respective sites Promotes federated data-sharing models for collaborative and joining analyses Addressed recurrent challenges faced by HDSS e.g. record linkage A platform for joint grant application across the network members Related Projects ONGOING PROJECT 2024 – 2024 The Gates Data System PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2019 – 2022 STRENGTHENING MEASUREMENT AND IMPACT EVALUATION CAPACITY AT APHRC ONGOING PROJECT 2020 – 2021 Sex, Gender and COVID-19 The Sex, Gender and Covid-19 Project is a partnership of Global Health 50/50 (UCL), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC).

{"text": "RESEARCH RESEARCH // WHAT WE DO // Data Science Program Data Science Program Focuses on maximizing the power of data for population and health research in Africa through the creation of platforms for Africa-led data sharing, data custody, and application of state-of-the-art big data analytics and artificial intelligence to foster advances in health and wellbeing in Africa. OVERVIEW Our work in this area leverages advances in platform development to create robust data systems that ensure data are shared, governed, and analyzed with novel methods. The Data Science program leverages internally and externally generated “big data” to explore patterns and predictions using data science, artificial intelligence tools, and modeling approaches to inform population health. Units and working groups Data Platforms and Systems . The team focuses on creating platforms and systems that support the data value chain. Current and planned platforms include; Data Science and Sharing Platform (DASSA) . This is a data-sharing platform with interfaces that support stories on data sharing, information on legal policies and frameworks for data protection in various African countries, provides modules for data sharing, and collates data from various sources – including internally generated research datasets at the center. No-Code Machine Learning Platform. This supports codeless machine learning algorithms easily deployed by researchers who are not necessarily data science professionals. The graphical user face allows users to use research datasets uploaded to the platform, and real-time predictive analytics are generated with accompanying interpretations for the user. Data Governance. The data governance team works closely with the data synergy team to develop a data governance framework for APHRC. Additional work includes creating a data governance curriculum on data governance, data anonymization, privacy-preserving technologies, and responsible data use. The Data Science team collaborates with the RRCS to deliver the proposed training. Data Harmonization and FAIR. The team of data documentationists and data scientists create data pipelines for various use cases and support on-premise and cloud-based data analysis through a federated approach. The team uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model – a standardized data model for health data with internationally recognized vocabularies. The platform harmonizes data generated internally and externally through the Center’s partnership projects across Africa and beyond. In addition, metadata for APHRC research datasets is indexed and made machine searchable using tools such as Schema.org to increase visibility and allow global data sharing. Data Analytics and Evaluation. A team of experienced data scientists, statisticians,s and mathematical modelers support data analytical support for “big-data” driven projects. The team uses machine learning techniques and new tools like Generative Artificial Intelligence to develop robust outputs that inform decision-making and impact lives through research. INSPIRE Network The Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE) is hosted by the Data Science Program. INSPIRE was birthed in 2019 as a Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSS) network in East Africa. The vision has since changed and now hosts about 20 HDSS sites in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda), Western Africa (Senegal, Burkina Faso), and Southern (Malawi) Africa. The INSPIRE secretariat provides; An annual general meeting to discuss value addition and collaboration among HDSS Period hybrid training in data harmonization for data managers at the respective sites Promotes federated data-sharing models for collaborative and joining analyses Addressed recurrent challenges faced by HDSS e.g. record linkage A platform for joint grant application across the network members Related Projects ONGOING PROJECT 2024 – 2024 The Gates Data System PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2019 – 2022 STRENGTHENING MEASUREMENT AND IMPACT EVALUATION CAPACITY AT APHRC ONGOING PROJECT 2020 – 2021 Sex, Gender and COVID-19 The Sex, Gender and Covid-19 Project is a partnership of Global Health 50/50 (UCL), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC).

Our research endeavors aim to advance understanding of significant population trends in Africa, their ecological interactions, and the implications of climate change for sustainable development. OVERVIEW Our critical areas of work broadly include: Aging and Development: We investigate the dynamics of population aging in Africa, analyzing its impact on well-being, life-course trajectories, transitions to long-term care, and access to essential services for older populations. Our focus extends to adapting societal structures to accommodate demographic shifts, promoting age-friendly environments, and enhancing the socio-economic support systems vital for older populations. Urbanization and Sustainability: PDU explores the broader issues of migration and urbanization in Africa and their implications for developing sustainable and resilient cities. We particularly focus on the growth of informal settlements within Africa’s rapid urbanization context, seeking to generate robust evidence on social determinants of health and well-being to inform policy and action towards addressing unique challenges of slum dwellers, transcending urban poverty to foster inclusive and sustainable urban development. Fertility: Our research emphasizes understanding fertility determinants in Africa, probing why fertility rates remain persistently high in specific contexts, identifying factors contributing to stalled fertility declines, and investigating rapid declines among specific demographic groups.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) – Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) – The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH—ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people’s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better. Related Projects PROJECT ONGOING PROJECT 2020 – 2021 Surveillance and Epidemiologic Evaluation of COVID-19 in Kenya (SEECK) The burden of COVID-19 at population level is not known and prevention interventions are not fully supported by evidence. This project seeks to answer the question of: what proportion of the general population has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 before? The study is being conducted in the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) area (Korogocho and Viwandani informal settlements) on the outskirts of Nairobi City. Similar studies are being implemented in Kisumu and Kilifi by other research teams within the wider consortium. ONGOING PROJECT 2021 – 2023 PATIENT-LED SUPPORT GROUPS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION AND DIABETES IN KOROGOCHO AND VIWANDANDI INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS, NAIROBI, KENYA: MIXED METHODS STUDY OF AN INNOVATIVE MODEL (MRC PaLs) ONGOING PROJECT 2017 – 2021 Improving Healthcare Delivery in Informal Settlements Rapid urbanization in major cities in Africa, has contributed to a surge in informal settlements, also commonly referred to as slums. ONGOING PROJECT 2017 – 2019 Food Choices Project: Dietary transitions in African Cities Driven in part by the increasing migration of individuals to cities in many African countries, a change in dietary habits has been observed, with increasing consumption of unhealthy foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients.

Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes. Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people’s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better.

The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) – Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) – The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts.

Our work also aims to provide valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of maternal (perinatal) and adolescent mental health, contributing to better policies, practices, and support systems. Young people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR): We recognize the importance of investing in young people’s SRHR as a critical lever to harness the demographic dividend in Africa. We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better.

{"text": "RESEARCH RESEARCH // WHAT WE DO // Health and Wellbeing Health and Wellbeing The theme aims to promote the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health for every African as a fundamental human right in line with the universal declaration of human rights, and in alignment with the sustainable development agenda. The overarching objective of the theme is to generate evidence, build research and related capacity and influence policy and practice in health and wellbeing with a focus on nutrition and food systems; sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health; chronic diseases management; emerging and re-emerging infections and health systems strengthening. OVERVIEW Our work here aims to improve and contribute to the evidence base for effective intervention strategies and policies to promote the health and well-being of all people in Africa. The theme has five programs of work (Units): Nutrition and Food Systems; Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH); Chronic Diseases Management (CDM); Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) to respond to the COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) challenges; and Health Systems Strengthening. Nutrition and Food Systems (NFS) – Aims to generate evidence, build capability and influence policy and practice to promote positive food systems transformation for optimal nutrition and health in Africa. The unit has three focus areas: Maternal, Child and Adolescent Nutrition; Nutritional epidemiology; and food systems. The maternal, child and adolescent nutrition program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions to optimize the health of mothers, children under five years, school going children and adolescents, with a special focus on nutrition in the first 1000 days including breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The nutritional epidemiology program aims to improve the understanding of the role of diet in the etiology of health outcomes such as malnutrition including obesity in the African context, and identifying the determinants that influence diet. This area also focuses on evaluating interventions to improve dietary patterns, and translating nutritional epidemiology evidence into guidelines, policies and actions. The food systems program aims to inform policies, strategies and actions on food systems transformation towards healthy, nourishing, inclusive, human-centered, resilient and sustainable food systems. We focus on sustainable production, access to and consumption of sustainable healthy foods, to promote health and wellbeing, while promoting a healthy environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change challenges. We apply a human-rights based approach to food systems transformation, with a special focus on food sovereignty; and freedom from hunger and the right to adequate food especially for the most vulnerable. We build capability and agency of grassroots organizations including women and youth groups as a pathway to effective food systems transformation in communities. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (SRMNCAH) – The SRMNCAH Unit generates rigorous evidence that informs programs and policies to improve sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health in Africa. The SRMNCAH Unit has five focus areas: Maternal, newborn and child health: We seek to enhance access to safe, high-quality, and affordable maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care within the framework of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Our work takes a multifaceted approach, including generating evidence, adopting, testing, and adapting interventions to suit specific contexts. By pursuing this area of work, we aim to address one of the core challenges in MNCH—ensuring that mothers, newborns, and children have equitable access to essential healthcare services, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location. Maternal and adolescent mental health: We generate evidence related to the prevalence, underlying contexts, and dynamics of common maternal and adolescent mental health problems. We also seek to develop and test effective interventions to address prevailing mental health challenges among these demographics. Our work on maternal and adolescent mental health acknowledges the critical connection between maternal (perinatal) mental health and MNCH outcomes.

We advance this agenda by undertaking research to understand the drivers of young people’s SRHR with a focus on early adolescents (10-14 years), those from marginalized communities and those most-at-risk of being left behind as the world focuses on the achievement of the 2030 development agenda such as pregnant and parenting adolescents. Through strategic partnerships with program implementers working on young people’s SRHR, the Unit also generates evidence about what works to reach youth with safe, respectful and comprehensive SRHR information and services. Recognizing that education is an important social determinant of young people’s SRHR, we work with colleagues in the Human Development Theme to understand how to make education systems more inclusive (e.g., promoting school re-entry for pregnant and parenting adolescents). Abortion and family planning: We implement studies focused on understanding the contexts and dynamics of unsafe abortion, family planning, contraceptive attitudes and behaviors, and fertility, deepening our understanding of the mortality and morbidity associated with unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy, strengthening the measurement of unsafe abortion and unintended pregnancy; and assessing the impact of unsafe abortion prevention programs and barriers to quality post-abortion care. Gender and sexuality-related vulnerabilities Our research examines the drivers of sexual- and gender-based violence (SGBV) and interventions to address SGBV among different populations, including refugee populations. Our work also examines the lived experiences of sexual and gender minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and other gender non-conforming persons—LGBTQI+ people), including the interlinkages between their lived experiences and health outcomes. Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit – The Chronic Diseases Management (CDM) Unit aims to address the challenge of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive airway disease, mental disorders, neurological diseases, and arthritis through generating evidence on chronic disease management as a systematic approach to coordinating healthcare interventions across levels (individual, organizational, local, and national). The focus on “management” signals a shift away from the dominant notion of treatment and the intended outcome from “cure” to stewardship. Our core mandate is to co-design and evaluate new interventions or new ways of delivering known interventions in various African populations for the prevention of chronic diseases or care of people with chronic diseases. Key Research Questions The CDM unit addresses three key questions: What is the burden of, and forecast for, chronic diseases in Africa, and what are the context-specific environmental, behavioral, and genomic risk factors for chronic diseases in Africa? What are the best approaches and new tools to deliver known cost-effective interventions for preventing and caring for chronic diseases in Africa? How is the health system responding to manage chronic diseases, and what can be done to strengthen health systems to improve services for chronic diseases? Focus Areas The research in the CDM unit is grouped into five focus areas: Cancer Care Pathways (CANCER) The interplay of risk factors for chronic diseases and prevention (CDRISK) Food Environment Policy Action (FEP-ACT) Cardio-Metabolic Diseases Management (CMD) Mental Health and Neurological diseases (MEN) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) – Our Africa-led agenda to strengthen and build more resilient systems for improved health is addressing knowledge gaps related to chronic disease management, epidemiology and identifying mitigation strategies for the rising burden of injury. Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (ERID) – The Center will produce research on the emerging re-emerging infectious diseases across Africa in terms of epidemiology, understanding coverage of intervention and their impact as well developing and testing and innovations aimed at overcoming identified barriers. The areas of work are summarized below: To contribute to the understanding of the levels, distribution, drivers, and impact of major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Clarifying the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases is at the center of their prevention and control. We aim to design and conduct epidemiologic studies to improve our understanding of the levels, distribution, risk factors, and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. COVID-19 has demonstrated, to a new level, the value of countries being able to use data to understand the dynamics of the epidemics. Surveillance should be part of enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology of new and old epidemics. Using existing surveillance systems and data sources, we will aim to deepen our epidemiological understanding of various infectious diseases and thus inform programming. Surveillance to monitor existing epidemics and detection of new ones is limited and the systems, including laboratory capacity, are weak. Detection of the emergence of drug-resistant strains is also a function of active surveillance. We will focus on supporting the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in priority countries in East and Southern Africa (ESA) and West and Central Africa (WCA). To describe and identify gaps in the coverage of interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) dispensation aims to ensure that no one is left behind. However, continued delivery of health interventions as usual might achieve this. We aim to not only measure coverage of interventions but also identify barriers, and inequities, which often go undetected. We will focus on vaccine-preventable diseases, current epidemics such as COVID-19, and HIV and malaria. To assess the impact of large-scale public health interventions against major emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases Investment in the health sector as a proportion of a country’s GDP, while inadequate, is still substantial. As such, it is important to understand whether interventions in the sector are effective. While vaccines are available for some of the emerging (COVID-19) and re-emerging diseases (tuberculosis), uptake of the respective vaccine in some areas remains low. Over the years, we have built the capacity to conduct large-scale impact evaluations to help inform public health decisions. Test health systems innovations to increase access, uptake, and use of interventions with a focus on addressing inequities, reaching traditionally excluded sub-populations, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and proposing evidence-informed solutions to addressing barriers to accessing services Delivery of interventions often reaches a saturation point to the effect that more of the same does not lead to better health impact. Hard-to-reach sub-populations may remain uncovered/unreached by interventions and as such serve as the source of outbreaks and possibly development of resistance due to irrational use of antimicrobials. We aim to promote innovation to advance and improve access to critical public health interventions to ensure reduced inequality and inequity in disease burden. We will focus on harnessing community resources, the use of digital technology, and tweaking the healthcare system to serve hard-to-reach populations better."}

OVERVIEW In the stream of work on Education and Technology, we seek to understand how African countries can leverage technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. Education and Youth Empowerment (EYE) – The perspectives of equity, inclusion, and opportunities are the guiding principles for our work in EYE. Early Childhood Development (ECD) – Our focus is on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Areas of Focus: I nclusive Quality Education: is focused on understanding how to make education systems responsive to the learning needs of children and youth from diverse backgrounds. This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women’s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others. Youth and Transition to Work: Investigates pathways to the world of work among young people in SSA. This includes addressing issues of positive youth development, youth empowerment and skills development, skills-building and training systems and the future of work, apprenticeship programs for young people, and demand-driven training for the future of work. Education and Technology: Understanding how countries in SSA could leverage education technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children’s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women’s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8. We will use an approach that promotes equitable access to a high-quality early childhood experience and consider ways to enhance school readiness as children enter the schooling system at age 4 to ensure schooling success.

This involves addressing issues of quality, equity, and equality in education across various dimensions such as education in emergencies, special needs education, urban education, out-of-school children and youth, teaching effectiveness, learning outcomes and assessment, foundational skills, children farthest left behind in schooling opportunities, and building education system resilience during and after emergencies (such as COVID-19). Gender and Education: examines how education systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) respond to gender disparities and needs in education. This includes addressing issues of gender equity and equality, girls, and women’s education, including in STEM, sexuality education, and adolescent schooling, and policies and practices that promote gender equality, gender-friendly schools and curriculum, and engendered-teacher development programs, among others. Youth and Transition to Work: Investigates pathways to the world of work among young people in SSA. This includes addressing issues of positive youth development, youth empowerment and skills development, skills-building and training systems and the future of work, apprenticeship programs for young people, and demand-driven training for the future of work. Education and Technology: Understanding how countries in SSA could leverage education technology to solve existing and emerging educational challenges. This will include, but not be limited to, addressing EdTech in contemporary learning spaces, the future of physical classrooms, the digital divide, EdTech, and emergencies (e.g., COVID-19), virtual learning technology, innovative pedagogies, curriculum alignment to technology, and student learning. Higher Education Research: Understanding the impact and value of existing research capacity initiatives and what works to make higher education systems relevant and sustainable in Africa; STEM and national development goals, including 21st-century skills. Childcare Patterns: We work on establishing ways to promote quality childcare, especially for the urban poor, and establish the impact of quality childcare on children’s developmental outcomes. Our work will also operationalize and prioritize the components of the NCF that heighten child development, particularly among vulnerable children. Under this program, our work will also examine gender roles in childcare, focusing on unpaid care work and its effect on women’s economic empowerment. Integration of ECD into the health care system: Solidify our focus on informing the integration of ECD into the health care system. Early care and education (ECE): Establish how to support young children and their families from the prenatal period through the middle school period at age 8. We will use an approach that promotes equitable access to a high-quality early childhood experience and consider ways to enhance school readiness as children enter the schooling system at age 4 to ensure schooling success."}

Sustainable policy impact entails transformative change in systems, investments, programs, and behavior. The Center is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture of public engagement. We achieve this by engaging in genuine dialogues with defined local and global communities. Our mission is to inform and influence policy discussions and decision-making by identifying and nurturing champions within and outside government. Our ultimate goal is to stimulate greater interest in evidence-driven policies and programs. OVERVIEW We emphasize strong cross-organizational collaboration with a focus on structured and strategic engagement. We work within key thematic areas, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, food systems, health system strengthening, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), with gender and climate change as cross-cutting themes. While our primary focus is on these signature issues, we are flexible and occasionally collaborate on other significant topics. Our advocacy efforts take a comprehensive approach underpinning our commitment to driving substantial and lasting regional policy changes. It revolves around three strategies: Building partnerships with key policy stakeholders to lead policy changes and provide support in policy processes. Strengthening the capacity of strategic stakeholders within the African policy ecosystem to generate, synthesize, and utilize evidence for improved policy and practice. Promoting evidence-based decision-making through robust relationships, joint evidence projects, evidence co-creation, rapid synthesis, policy analysis, and problem-driven Political Economy Analyses (PEA).

Strongly grounded in international human rights standards, the SDGs aim for an inclusive world and put economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights and the right to development at the core of social progress.

Sustainable policy impact entails transformative change in systems, investments, programs, and behavior. The Center is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture of public engagement. We achieve this by engaging in genuine dialogues with defined local and global communities. Our mission is to inform and influence policy discussions and decision-making by identifying and nurturing champions within and outside government. Our ultimate goal is to stimulate greater interest in evidence-driven policies and programs. OVERVIEW We emphasize strong cross-organizational collaboration with a focus on structured and strategic engagement. We work within key thematic areas, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, food systems, health system strengthening, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), with gender and climate change as cross-cutting themes. While our primary focus is on these signature issues, we are flexible and occasionally collaborate on other significant topics. Our advocacy efforts take a comprehensive approach underpinning our commitment to driving substantial and lasting regional policy changes. It revolves around three strategies: Building partnerships with key policy stakeholders to lead policy changes and provide support in policy processes.
